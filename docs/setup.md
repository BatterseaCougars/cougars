# One-time setup

Everything here is free. It takes about an hour. Do the steps in order; each one says which value goes where.

There are two environments, each on its own Cloudflare account ([ADR 0010](adr/0010-environments-and-deploys.md)):
**production** (account _Cougars_, the live site) and **dev** (account _Cougars Dev_: PR previews, design
previews, your machine).

All secrets go into **Bitwarden Secrets Manager** and nowhere else. **Name every token exactly like its
secret**, for example a Cloudflare token called `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`. Each secret is described in
[README.md#secrets](../README.md#secrets); the rules are in [ADR 0002](adr/0002-secrets-in-bitwarden.md).

## 1. Cloudflare: two accounts (hosting + database)

Do this twice: once for **Cougars** (production), once for **Cougars Dev** (dev).

1. Create a free account at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up> (or add a second account to your login).
2. **Workers & Pages** → pick a `*.workers.dev` subdomain. The workers are `web` and `team` in both
   accounts: dev at `https://web.<subdomain>.workers.dev` and `https://team.<subdomain>.workers.dev`; production's site
   at its domain.
3. Copy the **Account ID** (account home page).
4. **Manage Account → Account API Tokens → Create Token** (account-owned, so it doesn't depend on one person's
   login). Scope **Entire _account_**; permissions **Workers Admin** (Editor can't create a new worker) and **D1 Write**. Name it
   `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN__PRODUCTION` on Cougars, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN__DEV` on Cougars Dev. Copy it.

Bitwarden secrets (step 3): `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID__PRODUCTION` in
`cougars`; `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN__DEV`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID__DEV` in `cougars-dev`.

## 2. Sanity (content editing)

Two free projects, one per environment, like the two Cloudflare accounts
([ADR 0010](adr/0010-environments-and-deploys.md)). Both exist already:

| Project         | ID         | Dataset               | Used by                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Cougars**     | `ah165efl` | `production` (public) | The live site and the hosted Studio                          |
| **Cougars Dev** | `zmg6rbe3` | `production` (public) | The dev site, PR previews, your machine and the local Studio |

The IDs are in `packages/shared/sanity.ts`; the environment picks the project, so nothing about them goes in Secrets
Manager. Public datasets need no read token.

To set up a project from scratch (or check one):

1. `npx sanity login` with your own account, then create the project at <https://www.sanity.io/manage> (Free
   plan) with one public dataset, `production`, and put its ID in `packages/shared/sanity.ts`.
2. **API → CORS origins**:
   - Cougars Dev: `http://localhost:4520` to `http://localhost:4523`, with credentials (local Studios, including
     worktrees).
   - Cougars: nothing to add; the hosted Studio adds its own origin when it's deployed.
3. **Cougars → API → Tokens**: a **Deploy Studio** token named `SANITY_DEPLOY_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`, into Secrets
   Manager (`cougars`). CI deploys the Studio with it on every push to `release`.
4. Seed the club facts (Club, Fridays, Pub, Team, Kumite) from the website's defaults, dev first. The scripts use
   your own login:
   ```sh
   npm run seed -w @cougars/studio                                    # Cougars Dev
   SANITY_STUDIO_SITE_ENV=production npm run seed -w @cougars/studio  # Cougars
   ```
   A project that still has the old `siteSettings` document is migrated instead: run
   `npm run migrate-settings -w @cougars/studio` (a dry run), then again with `-- --commit`.
5. **Members**: invite the club's editors to **Cougars** with the _Editor_ role (the Free plan includes 20
   seats), and to **Cougars Dev** if they want somewhere to practise. Vision, the query tool, only appears for
   administrators.

## 3. Bitwarden Secrets Manager

1. At <https://bitwarden.com>, create a free **organisation**, then enable **Secrets Manager** (the Free plan is
   enough).
2. Create two projects: **`cougars`** (production values, `NAME__PRODUCTION`) and **`cougars-dev`** (dev values,
   `NAME__DEV`, and shared plain `NAME`s). Add the secrets from steps 1, 2 and 5 with exactly those names.
3. **Machine accounts**, each with one access token (names and the matrix are in
   [README.md#bitwarden-tokens](../README.md#bitwarden-tokens)):
   - `cougars-ci`: `cougars` and `cougars-dev`. Token `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`, in GitHub environment `production`.
   - `cougars-ci-dev`: `cougars-dev` only. Token `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN__DEV`, in GitHub environment `preview`.
   - `cougars-ci` and `cougars-ci-dev` get **Can read** only.
   - `cougars-local`: **Can read, write** on both, so you can add secrets from the shell. Token
     `COUGARS_LOCAL_BW_TOKEN`, in your vault as a secure note `cougars/.env.local` with the line
     `COUGARS_LOCAL_BW_TOKEN=...`.
4. If your vault is on the EU server (`vault.bitwarden.eu`), remember that for step 4.

Locally, **`bw-unlock` is the login**: once per container start, then every script finds the token itself. The
devcontainer keeps its own Bitwarden login (volume `cougars-bitwarden-cli`), separate from your host's.

```sh
bw config server https://vault.bitwarden.eu   # once
bw login                                      # once, as the account in the Cougars org
bw-unlock                                     # each container start
node scripts/env-pull.mjs --status            # lists secret names (dev)
```

## 4. GitHub

In `battersea-cougars/ark` → **Settings**:

1. **Environments**:
   - `production`: deployment branches **`release` only**. Secret `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`.
   - `preview`: Secret `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN__DEV`.
   - No repository-level secrets.
2. **Variables → Actions** (optional):
   - `BWS_SERVER_URL`: `https://vault.bitwarden.eu` if your vault is on the EU server.
3. Deploy dev once, so the `web` worker exists before the first PR preview:
   ```sh
   node scripts/env-pull.mjs -- bash scripts/deploy-dev.sh
   ```

`main` deploys dev; `git push origin main:release` deploys production ([ADR 0010](adr/0010-environments-and-deploys.md)). The
first production deploy creates the D1 database and applies migrations.

## 5. Publish → rebuild (deferred to the team app)

Not set up ([ADR 0004](adr/0004-astro-workers-sanity-d1.md)). Studio changes reach the live site at the daily
rebuild (04:30 UK winter, 05:30 summer) or the next release. Photos are read live and need no rebuild. To publish
something sooner, start a production rebuild by hand: **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow → `release`**, or
`gh workflow run deploy.yml --ref release`.

The team app will start rebuilds when content changes, the way Gwenda's ops does.

## 6. Domain

`batterseacougars.com`, bought 2026-10-06 with Cloudflare Registrar (at cost, about $10.50 a year, auto-renew on)
on the **Cougars** account. Registrar lock and contact privacy are on by default; turn on DNSSEC (**DNS → Settings**)
and keep two-factor login on the account, which controls the domain.

Nothing is done by hand: `deploy.yml` sets production's `SITE_URL` to `https://batterseacougars.com`, and
`scripts/ci/target.mjs` attaches it and `www.` to the `cougars` worker as custom domains, so the first `release`
deploy creates the DNS records and certificates. That needs the zone permissions on
[`CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`](../README.md#cloudflare_api_token__production). Dev stays on workers.dev: it's a
separate Cloudflare account, and a domain can only point at workers in its own.

The form rate limit and the edge cache start working on the domain: Cloudflare's Cache API is disabled on
`*.workers.dev`. At launch, switch the Google Auth Platform **Branding** URLs to the domain (README.md#gmail).

**Rate limiting** (#57): the zone's one free rate-limiting rule blocks an address that sends more than 150 requests in
10 seconds (per Cloudflare data centre) for 10 seconds, on the site, `www.` and the team app, before a scraper costs a
Worker request. The Workers' own limits on forms and sign-in still apply behind it. 150 leaves room for a whole club on
the rink's Wi-Fi (one address) opening the app at once. It's written by
`node scripts/env-pull.mjs --environment production -- node scripts/ratelimit-setup.mjs`, which needs **Zone WAF
Write** on the production token; change the number there and run it again. Seen under Security → WAF → Rate limiting
rules.

**Web Analytics**: on for batterseacougars.com (added 2026-10-10 in the dashboard: Analytics & Logs → Web Analytics),
with automatic setup, so Cloudflare adds its script to the site's pages and there's nothing in the code. A rule keeps it
off `team.batterseacougars.com`. It counts page views without cookies (the privacy page says so). Its API refuses the
account tokens we use, so it's set up by hand. When the website gets a real CSP (#78), allow
`https://static.cloudflareinsights.com` (script) and `https://cloudflareinsights.com` (connect).
