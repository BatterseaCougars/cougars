# 0095. Each change declares what it puts on the audit log, on its route, and the log has a page in plain words

- **Status:** Accepted

## Context

[0024](0024-action-based-authorization.md) promised that role changes, permission changes and refused requests go in
`audit_log`, and [0023](0023-sign-in-and-sessions.md) put sign-ins there. Until the security review of 2026-10-09
only sign-ins, sign-outs and capped sign-ins were written, and nothing read the table: an admin wanting to know who
gave someone a role, or who kept poking at admin routes, had to query D1 by hand.

Writing each entry as an `audit()` call in the handler is imperative: a new route that changes who can do what has to
remember to call it, and nothing notices when it doesn't. Auditing is a cross-cutting concern, and routes already
declare their others the same way: `action` (who may) and `changes` (what comes back) are properties of the route,
applied by one wrapper and held by a test.

Decorators were considered. TypeScript's decorate class members, and the Worker has no classes: a route is an object
in a table. A decorator around a handler would also see only the request and the status, which makes a request log
("PUT /api/members/3"), not a record ("Reg: roles Member → Helper, Member").

## Decision

**Writing**

- **Every route that isn't a GET declares `audit`**: what it puts on the record, or `false` for nothing. A test fails
  on any that doesn't, as it does for `changes`, so the choice is made on purpose for each new route.
- **A declaration is data**: an `event` name, a `subject` (one read of the thing the change is to: a member's
  standing, a role's actions, a sign-in email) and optionally `about` (the member or role, by id, for the page to
  name).
- **The wrapper does the rest** (`handleApi` in `worker/api.ts`): it reads the subject before the handler and after
  it, and when the two differ writes one entry with who did it, `from`, `to` and `about`. A refused or failed change
  writes nothing; a change that changes nothing (the same roles saved again) writes nothing.
- **Readers live with their domain** (`memberStanding`, `roleSummary` in people.ts; `sessionSignups` in teams.ts;
  `draftProgress` in draft.ts; `tournamentSummary` in schedule.ts), so "what does this change touch" is answered once.
- On the record from declarations: `member.updated` (status, roles), `member.email`, `member.added`,
  `member.quarterly`, `role.created`, `role.updated`, `dev_mail.changed`, `tournament.deleted`, `session.reset`,
  `draft.reset`. From the wrapper itself: `refused` (every 403, with the method, path and missing action).
- **Not declarative, and staying that way:** sign-in's own events (`sign_in`, `sign_out`, `sign_in.capped`,
  `access.requested`), written by explicit `audit()` calls in `worker/auth.ts`. Sign-in routes run before anyone is
  known and aren't in the route table; their events are what happened, not a change to compare.

**Reading**

- **A new action, `read:Audit`** ("See the audit log: who changed what, and when"). Admins hold it through
  `manage:all`; it can be given to a role like any other.
- **`GET /api/audit`** returns the newest entries first, a page at a time (`before=<id>` for the next page, up to 200
  a page). Each entry names who acted and, where its detail names a member or a role, that one by its current name,
  so the page needs no other data to say what happened.
- **Settings → Audit log**, under Security (`AuditLog.svelte`): one line per entry, by day, in plain words ("Dana
  changed Reg: roles Member → Helper, Member", "Pat was refused GET /api/usage: needs \"See the club's free
  Cloudflare allowance\""). Refusals and capped sign-ins stand out. "Earlier" reads the next page.

## Consequences

- An admin can answer "who did this?" from their phone, and sees attempts at admin routes without being told.
- Adding a route means deciding its record in the same place as its permission. Forgetting is a failing test.
- A new kind of entry needs a line in the page's `said()`; an event the page doesn't know still shows, as its name
  and detail, so nothing is silent.
- A subject is read twice per audited change: two small indexed reads, on the few routes that change who can do what.
- A subject must read the same way both times; one that includes a timestamp or an order that drifts would record
  changes that didn't happen. The readers sort what they return.
- The log holds names and emails (a changed sign-in email, an added member's). It's behind `read:Audit`, and the
  table is personal data like the rest of D1 ([0029](0029-personal-data.md)).

## History

- 2026-10-09: The audit log gets a page and `read:Audit`; the review adds member, role, sign-in email, dev mail and
  refused entries, each an explicit `audit()` call in its handler (was 0095).
- 2026-10-09: Each non-GET route declares its record and the wrapper writes it by comparing before and after; dev mail
  entries become `dev_mail.changed`, and tournament, session and draft resets join (was 0098).
