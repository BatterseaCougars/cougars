# Architecture decision records

Short records of the decisions that shape the project: what we decided, why, and what it costs us. There is **one
record per topic** ([0001](0001-record-decisions.md)). Read the relevant one before changing how something works.

- **Changing a decision:** update its topic's record in the same change as the code. Rewrite what no longer holds,
  add a dated line to its **History**, and bump _updated_.
- **A new topic:** copy [template.md](template.md) and take the next unused number (the next is **0102**). Numbers are
  never reused.
- **An old number** (from a commit, an issue or a chat) that has no file any more was merged into another record.
  `grep -l 0035 docs/adr/*.md` finds it on that record's _Merges_ line.
