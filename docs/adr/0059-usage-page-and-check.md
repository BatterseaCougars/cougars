# 0059. Admins see the free Cloudflare allowance and CPU time, and are emailed at 80% or a stopped request

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-07 · updated 2026-10-09
- **Merges:** 0063

## Context

One Cloudflare account runs the website, the team app and their database, on the free plan: 100,000 Worker requests,
5 million D1 rows read and 100,000 written a day, reset at 00:00 UTC. If one runs out, the team app stops until then
and the website's live pages fail (its prerendered pages are free and keep working). The app's own brake
([0055](0055-degrade-instead-of-break.md)) stops it running away; something also has to tell someone the allowance is
being spent, by a scraper or anything else. The live hub ([0072](0072-live-updates.md)) adds Durable Objects' own free
allowance: 100,000 requests and 13,000 GB-s of duration a day.

On the Workers free plan a request may also compute for 10 ms. Waiting on D1, Sanity or another fetch doesn't count;
running our code does (rendering, JSON, loops, crypto). Past 10 ms Cloudflare stops the request and it fails with
error 1102. The same applies to a cron run. Raising the limit needs Workers Paid ([0003](0003-free-tiers-only.md)).

## Decision

- **Settings → Security → Usage** (`read:Usage`; admins have it through `manage:all`) shows, against the free limits,
  today's Worker requests, D1 rows read and rows written, the live hub's Durable Object requests and duration (GB-s),
  and when they reset in London time. It also shows each Worker's CPU time per request today: typical (p50) and the
  slowest 1 in 100 (p99), against 10 ms, and how many requests were stopped for going over. The live-update pace
  setting sits beside it ([0072](0072-live-updates.md)).
- **An hourly check** (the team Worker's cron trigger, `7 * * * *`, free) emails the admins once a day per metric when
  one passes 80%, and once a day (metric `cpu`) when any request was stopped, with the count per Worker. It goes
  through the usual mail rules (outside production, only to the safe address). `usage_warnings` remembers what was
  sent each day, claimed before sending so two runs send one email.
- Both read Cloudflare's GraphQL analytics in one query (`team/app/worker/usage.ts`): `workersInvocationsAdaptive`
  sums and quantiles, the same dataset filtered to `status: "exceededResources"`, and the Durable Object datasets.
  They use a **read-only token**, `CLOUDFLARE_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` (Account Analytics Read), never the deploy token,
  which shouldn't live in a Worker. Without it the page says how to set it up and the check does nothing; if
  Cloudflare can't be read, the page says so.
- **Code is written to stay well under 10 ms**: aggregate in SQL rather than in JavaScript, page anything that grows
  (`LIMIT`), do heavy work at build time (prerendered pages) or in the browser, and never hash passwords or process
  images in a Worker. Sign-in is a code or link ([0023](0023-sign-in-and-sessions.md)), not a password.

## Consequences

- Admins hear about a runaway or a scraper with a fifth of the day left, not when the app stops.
- A slow route shows up as a rising p99 before it fails, and a failure is an email, not a member's report.
- The check costs 24 Worker requests and two small queries a day; CPU time comes from the same query.
- Tests can't measure Worker CPU (Node and in-memory SQLite aren't workerd), so the guard is this measurement in
  production plus the rules above, not a test.
- It only runs where the team app is deployed; locally the page works on a dev server started through env-pull.
  Sanity's usage isn't readable through its API, so the page points to sanity.io/manage.

## History

- 2026-10-07: The Usage page and an hourly 80% check for Worker requests and D1 rows, with a read-only analytics token
  (was 0059).
- 2026-10-07: CPU time per request (p50, p99, stopped) on the page, an email when a request is stopped, and the rules
  for staying under 10 ms (was 0063).
- 2026-10-09: The live hub's Durable Object requests and duration added to the page and the 80% check (ADR 0072).
