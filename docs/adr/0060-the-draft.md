# 0060. A captains' draft is run by an admin, picked by its captains, and seen by members once it's closed

## Context

The Kumite's teams are drafted: members sign up, captains are assigned, and on the night the captains pick in turns
([0030](0030-training-and-tournament-schedule.md) has tournament kinds and teams). The first draft let captains pick
from midnight on the draft day with no end, kept withdrawn members on their teams, and let a save of the tournament's
editor rewrite every team mid-draft. Draft night is busy and on phones: one mis-tap must not lose a pick, a draft that
goes wrong needs a way back, and who was picked first or last is the stuff of a week's arguments.

## Decision

### Lifecycle

- `tournaments.draft_state`: none (reads as scheduled while it has a day and captains) → **open** → **closed**. Whoever
  runs the draft (`run:Draft`) opens and closes it; nothing happens on its own.
- Opening needs at least two captains, and the first time enough sign-ups for every team to have its captain and two
  more (`MIN_TEAM_SIZE`, `playersNeeded` in `src/lib/draft.ts`). Otherwise 409.
- Closing needs everyone picked, or the admin choosing to leave the rest out. Closed locks the picks and the captains.
- **A closed draft reopens**, keeping its picks: the captain on the clock is whoever's next, as if it had never
  closed. Adding a player to a closed draft is refused (409): reopen it first.
- **Reset** (`run:Draft`, open or closed) takes every pick off and sets `draft_state` back to none. Sign-ups, captains
  (and admin-added players, who are sign-ups) and the fixtures stay. It's allowed after games have results; the app
  asks first, since it can't be undone.
- The draft night is on the agenda for its captains and whoever runs the draft until it's closed
  ([0042](0042-website-reads-the-club-agenda.md)); a reset puts it back.

### Picking

- Picks only while it's open, in snake order, from members who said they're in. **Captains are in automatically**, on
  their own team, never in the pool, and can't withdraw themselves.
- Each pick has a `pick_number` (`tournament_team_players`): turn order and Undo (the last pick) follow it.
- **Picking is two steps.** Pick marks a player on your screen (tap another to change your mind); **End turn** sends
  it. The server is unchanged: a pick is one request. Whoever runs the draft picks for the captain on the clock the
  same way. Picking out of turn, or someone no longer in the pool, is a 409.
- **One goalie a team** (`members.position = 'G'`), counting its captain, however someone gets onto a team: a
  captain's pick, a pick by whoever runs it, or an admin's team edit. A second is refused: "They've got a goalie
  already." Teams that enter whole (`kind: "teams"`) bring their own side. The Draft page has goalies as their own
  filter, shows each team's D/F/G count, and drops Pick from a goalie's row once your team has one.
- Withdrawing while the draft is open takes the pick off their team; once it's closed, or for a captain, it goes
  through an admin.

### Where it's edited

- The Draft page is for picking and running the draft (open, close, reopen, reset, Undo, Add player). It shows the
  teams but doesn't edit them.
- Teams are edited on the **Teams page** (`/tournaments/:slug/teams`): every team and its players, Edit opening the
  team drawer over it (`manage:Tournament`). The page itself is everyone's (`read:Event`).
- The tournament editor changes teams **in place** (by id), never writes a draft's players, and can't change the
  captains or their order once the draft is open. A save without some rules keeps the tournament's own, not the
  series'.

### Who sees what

- The server decides, in the `tournaments` slice (`draftSeenBy` in `worker/api/api.slices.ts`). A draft's captains, whoever runs
  it (`run:Draft`) and admins who edit teams (`manage:Tournament`) see everything, live.
- Anyone else, while it's scheduled or open: the captains and no players.
- Once it's closed: the teams with no pick numbers, each team's players in an order that says nothing (a hash of team
  and player, so it's the same each time and nothing moves on a refresh).
- Home tells members the draft is on (news, nothing to open) and, once it's closed, that the teams are out, linking to
  the Teams page. Captains and whoever runs the draft keep their Home link to the Draft page.

### The draft and the fixtures are independent

A draft's captains are its teams, so fixtures can be made before, during or after the draft
([0061](0061-fixtures-games-and-scoring.md)). Neither waits for the other, and a reset leaves the fixtures alone.

## Consequences

- A draft can't be left running by itself or rewritten by a stale editor, and a test draft can be run on the real
  tournament and thrown away.
- A captain who picks and walks away holds the draft until they end their turn; whoever runs it can pick for them.
- With fewer goalies than teams, the last teams go without; the page says so, which is a reason to take one early. A
  team whose goalie drops out gets a replacement through the admin's team edit, once the first has come off.
- Resetting after games are played empties the teams' rosters while their results stand.
- A member picked during the draft doesn't see their team until it closes; reopening hides the teams again.
- Captains' phones see a reset's picks vanish at the next live update ([0072](0072-live-updates.md)); nothing tells
  them why.

## History

- 2026-10-07: The first draft let captains pick from midnight on draft day with no end, and saving the editor
  replaced every team (was 0052).
- 2026-10-07: An admin opens and closes the draft; picks numbered, captains in automatically, teams edited in place,
  closed is final (was 0060).
- 2026-10-07: An admin can reset a draft, taking the picks and the fixtures, refused once a game had a result (was 0064).
- 2026-10-07: Fixtures no longer wait for the draft to close; a closed draft reopens; a reset only takes the picks and
  is allowed after results (was 0066).
- 2026-10-08: One goalie a team, for every way onto a team (was 0067).
- 2026-10-08: Pick then End turn, so a mis-tap isn't sent; teams edited on their own Teams page, not the Draft page
  (was 0068).
- 2026-10-08: The server hides picks from members until the draft closes, then shows teams in no order; the Teams page
  opens to everyone (was 0070).
