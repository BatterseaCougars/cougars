# 0100. Tournament results are built into the website from D1, and the team app rebuilds it when one changes

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-09 · updated 2026-10-09

## Context

The team app records a tournament from start to finish: its teams, every game and goal, who scored and assisted, the
champions and the awards an admin confirms ([0061](0061-fixtures-games-and-scoring.md),
[0044](0044-champions-and-awards.md)). The website showed only its date (the agenda,
[0042](0042-website-reads-the-club-agenda.md)). Its champions board read Sanity `kumiteResult` documents, which
someone would type in by hand after each Kumite; neither Sanity project had any.

Three ways were open:

- **Write results to Sanity** and rebuild. Two copies of every result, a Sanity write token on the Worker, and names
  that stop following what each player chose (a player who renames themself, or leaves, stays in Sanity as they were).
- **Read D1 live** on every visit, like What's on. One copy, but every view is a Worker request, and the website and
  the team app share one account's 100,000 a day: a bot on the website could stop the team app.
- **Build the results into the pages from D1**, and rebuild when one changes. One copy, and a page view costs
  nothing. Results change a few times a year.

## Decision

- **D1 is the record; the website's build reads it.** The build's club snapshot (`scripts/club-snapshot.mjs`, as for
  the roster, [0043](0043-roster-and-names.md)) reads every public tournament's rows (`scripts/lib/results-sql.mjs`)
  into the gitignored `results.local.json`. `apps/web/src/lib/results.ts` works the results out from them. Nothing is
  written to Sanity.
- **What's published:** a tournament that's public (`tournaments.public`) and done. Done is the app's rule, in
  `@cougars/shared/results`: marked finished, or every game played. One being played isn't shown; that's the live
  page (#48).
- **One rule set.** The table, the champion and "done" live in `@cougars/shared/results`, used by the Worker, the app
  and the website, so they can't disagree.
- **Static pages.** `/results/` lists every published tournament, newest first; `/results/<id>/` shows its champions,
  awards with their winners, the table, every score, the scorers and the teams. The champions board on the home page
  and `/kumite/` is built in. Crests are written as files (`/crests/<team id>.webp`), only for published teams, never
  SVG. Award winners show only once an admin has confirmed them; with no confirmed Champions, the champions are worked
  out from the games.
- **A changed result rebuilds the website.** Any change through the team app's API to a tournament that's done before
  or after it (the last game scored, a goal corrected, awards confirmed, renamed, made private, deleted) marks a
  rebuild wanted (`website_rebuild`, `apps/team/worker/website/website.ts`). A cron every five minutes sends it once there's
  been no change for five minutes, so a results day is one rebuild. As the club's GitHub App, **Cougars rebuilds**,
  owned by the organisation so it outlives any maintainer (README#github_app_private_key), it runs `deploy.yml` for
  the website (`workflow_dispatch`, `apps: web`) from its environment's branch: `main` for dev, `release` for
  production. The App can start workflows and nothing else, and each token it takes asks for only that: a leaked key
  can't push code (#71). If GitHub can't be reached, the next check tries again. A laptop's server never asks.
- **Names.** Every player is shown by the name they chose on their profile (`members.web_name`), else first name and
  initial (`@cougars/shared/names`, as on the roster). That includes members who aren't Cougars, and players from
  outside the club, who have no profile. A team with no name of its own is "Team" and its captain's chosen name, else
  their first name. A full name never reaches a page.
- **Player stats** on `/team/` and the back of a card add goals, assists and titles, from published tournaments only,
  in the roster snapshot (`scripts/lib/roster-sql.mjs`, #65). Goals and assists count from played games, as on a
  result. A title is a tournament whose Champions an admin confirmed, on that team as captain or player.
- Sanity's `kumiteResult` type, its query and the Studio schema are gone.

## Consequences

- Results cost nothing per view and can't use up the account's Worker requests; if D1 is down, the pages still show
  the last build.
- A result is on the website about ten minutes after the last change: five quiet minutes, then the build.
- A player's renamed or a tournament's series renamed shows at the next build: the daily one, or the next result.
- One more secret (the App's key) on the team Worker, and one more cron (free). The Worker's settings name the App
  (`wrangler.jsonc` vars).
- Each rebuild is a few GitHub Actions minutes; the repo is public, so they're free.
- A past Kumite played before the app has no record on the website. If the club wants one, it goes in the app as a
  tournament.
- The privacy notice says that results and stats show each player's chosen name.

## History

- 2026-10-09: Results are read from D1 live instead of written to Sanity; `kumiteResult` retired.
- 2026-10-09: Results are built into the pages from the snapshot instead of read live, so visits can't spend the
  account's Worker requests; the team app rebuilds the website through the club's GitHub App when a result changes.
- 2026-10-10: The rebuild runs `deploy.yml` directly (`workflow_dispatch`) instead of a `repository_dispatch`, so the
  App needs Actions: write, not Contents: write (#71).
