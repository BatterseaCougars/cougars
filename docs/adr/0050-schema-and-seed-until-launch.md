# 0050. Until launch, the database is a schema and a seed, not migrations

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-07 · updated 2026-10-10

## Context

Every change to the database was a numbered migration: sixteen of them before anything went live, several only
adding one column, some fixing the one before. Nothing is live (there's no `release` branch; production has never
been deployed), so nobody's data needs migrating. What matters is the dev database: the club's members, schedule and
settings, entered in the app, which will become production.

## Decision

- Until launch, `db/schema.sql` is the database: every table and index, changed directly. `db/seed/club.sql` holds
  what it starts with that isn't personal (roles, Friday Training, the Kumite series, quips), `INSERT OR IGNORE` by
  id. The roster stays in Secrets Manager (ADR 0029).
- `scripts/db-rebuild.mjs` rebuilds a database from the schema and keeps its data: it reads every row out (backing
  them up to a private temp file), drops the tables, makes them again, puts the rows back (a new column takes its
  default; a column that's gone is dropped and said so), and tops up the club seed. Local runs it with
  `npm run db:rebuild:local`; dev runs it on every deploy, in place of `wrangler d1 migrations apply`.
- Tests build their database from the same schema and seed.
- **Production starts fresh, not as a copy of dev, and never rebuilds.** Launch is one command,
  `node scripts/db-launch.mjs`, in the change that first goes to `release`: `schema.sql` and the club seed become
  `db/migrations/0001_launch.sql`, and the two files go. Production's first deploy builds its database from that
  migration, and the roster (`TEAM_ROSTER__PRODUCTION`) holds only the admins. They bring the members in with Import
  members ([0069](0069-members.md)). Dev keeps its data for trying things.
- **After launch, migrations only**, additive (the rule before this ADR): `deploy.yml` runs
  `wrangler d1 migrations apply` once `db/migrations/` has any, and refuses to rebuild production when it hasn't;
  `db-rebuild.mjs` refuses once it has; the tests build their database from the migrations.
- Every deploy that changes the database backs it up first ([0106](0106-database-backups.md)).

## Consequences

- A schema change is one edit; local and dev pick it up with their data intact.
- A rebuild rewrites every row, so it's for a small database: fine for one club before launch, not after.
- Renaming a column loses that column's data in a rebuild (it's read out under the old name): copy it across by hand
  in the same change, or don't rename before launch.
- The old migrations are gone from the tree; git history has them.

## History

- 2026-10-07: Until launch, the database is a schema and a seed, not migrations.
- 2026-10-09: Production starts fresh (schema, club seed, its two admins) and is filled by an import, instead of
  becoming a copy of dev's data.
- 2026-10-10: The switch is built: `scripts/db-launch.mjs` makes migration 0001; CI migrates once there are migrations
  and never rebuilds production; a backup before every schema change (#76, ADR 0106).
