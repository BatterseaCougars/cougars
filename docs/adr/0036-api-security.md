# 0036. Every API response sends only what that caller may see, decided on the server, and every page is hardened

## Context

Security reviews of the team app (2026-10-06, before sign-in went live, and 2026-10-09) found the UI doing the
server's job:

- The bootstrap sent every signed-in member everyone's email, phone, payment reference and rating, and the names
  and emails of strangers asking to join. Later it still sent who pays quarterly, every session's no-shows and
  walk-ins, who said they're out of every event, every member's roles and every role's actions, and the contact of
  every outside team entered in a tournament. The screens showing these are admin screens; the data was in every
  member's devtools.
- Anyone who could manage members could make themselves Admin. Anyone who could manage roles could add `manage:all`
  to a role they held.
- Forms on another site could post to the API wherever `SameSite=Lax` cookies let them through: from a sibling
  subdomain, or as `text/plain`.
- The security headers reached only `/api/*`. The team app's `wrangler.jsonc` runs the Worker first for `/api/*`
  alone, so the app's page and files came straight from Cloudflare's asset layer with none of them, and the
  website's prerendered pages never had any. The test that proved the headers called the Worker directly, so it
  couldn't see this.

The repo is public and members' details are personal data ([0029](0029-personal-data.md)). Once real people sign
in ([0023](0023-sign-in-and-sessions.md)), anything the API sends is effectively published to whoever receives it.
Dev's data becomes production's at launch ([0050](0050-schema-and-seed-until-launch.md)), so the time to stop
sending it is before anyone real signs in.

## Decision

**Every route is designed for its least trusted caller.** The UI hiding something is never the protection.

**Rows and fields are filtered on the server, per caller.** A response holds only what the caller's actions allow.
A new field or route starts private and is opened up deliberately. Filtering is in the club read
(`apps/team/worker/api/api.club.ts`): who's asking is a row of the statement, so what they may not see never leaves D1. The
slices are made from it, so a change's reply (`changed`, [0057](0057-team-app-loading-and-changes.md)) is filtered
exactly as the bootstrap is. Of anything
personal, a member is sent **their own**, and everyone's only with the action that needs it:

Unchanged, because they're the point of the screen or already public: who's in and waiting (a sign-up list), a
member's name, position, bio, website name, Cougar flag and sessions played (all on the public website roster for
Cougars, and on the player card), and a closed draft's teams ([0060](0060-the-draft.md)).

`impersonate:Member` gets everyone's roles because view as a member is worked out in the browser from their roles
([0024](0024-action-based-authorization.md)). If it moves to the server, that action drops out of the list.

**You can't grant what you don't have.** Only `manage:all` may give out any action. Anyone else may:

- give a member only roles whose actions they hold themselves;
- create or change only roles whose old and new actions they hold;
- change a member (their details, roles, status or sign-in email) only if that member can do nothing they can't.

So a member manager can't make an admin, demote one, or take over an admin's account by changing its email.

**Changes come only from the app's own pages.** Every POST, PUT and DELETE with an `Origin` header must have the
app's own origin; with no `Origin`, it must carry `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`, and a change with neither is refused:
every browser's fetch sends one, so only a script sends neither (`sameOrigin` in `worker/api/api.http.ts`). Only JSON bodies are accepted. GET requests change nothing (bootstrap's adding
of future sessions is idempotent).

**Security headers on every page, file and response, from both layers.**

- Both apps carry a `_headers` file in `public/`, which Workers static assets apply to everything they serve. The
  Worker (team app, `worker/index.ts`) and the middleware (website's live routes) set the same set on what they
  answer. A test in each app reads the file and checks it equals the code's set, so the two can't drift.
- **The team app** sends `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: same-origin`
  and a **content security policy**: only its own scripts, styles (inline allowed: Svelte sets style attributes),
  fonts and files; talks only to its own origin; its own images plus `data:` (team logos) and `blob:` (upload
  previews); no objects, no other base, forms only to itself, `frame-ancestors 'none'`. A new outside resource means
  widening the policy on purpose, in both places.
- **The website** sends `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `nosniff` and
  `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (it links out and is public, so the origin may travel). A full
  policy for the website (YouTube, Sanity's CDN, Turnstile) is left for when it's worth the upkeep.

**Tests prove it**:

- `apps/team/worker/api/api.security.test.ts`: every route refuses someone who isn't signed in (401); every route refuses a
  member whose role lacks its action (403); the grant rules hold; other sites' requests and non-JSON bodies are
  refused; and each row of the table above is a story: what a plain member sees, what they see of themselves, and
  what whoever runs the register sees. A new route is covered by the first two automatically. A new private field
  needs its own assertion.
- **The deploy's smoke test** fetches the team app's `/` and fails without `X-Frame-Options`, so the headers are
  checked where they're served, not only in a unit test.

## Consequences

- Each new route asks, for every field and row it returns: who is this for?
- A plain member's devtools show the club's calendar, who's coming, and themselves. Nothing about anyone's payments,
  attendance record, permissions or contact details.
- Admin-only screens get their data from the server only when the caller may see it. A screen showing an empty value
  for someone else's email is the server working, not a bug.
- A screen built later for plain members that wants one of the private fields has to argue for it here first.
- Payment references follow the member's id (`COU-0001`), so they aren't secret. They're still sent only to the
  member and to managers.
- Dues are gated on the server (`read:Dues`, `record:Payment`) from the start ([0007](0007-dues-and-payments.md)).
- Every page and file from either app is unframeable and unsniffable, and the team app's page can't run a script or
  reach a host that isn't its own, which limits what any injected content could do.
- Adding a CDN, an embed or an analytics script to the team app takes a deliberate change to the policy in
  `worker/index.ts` and `public/_headers`; the test fails until both agree.

## History

- 2026-10-06: A review before sign-in went live: responses filtered per caller on the server, no granting what you
  don't hold, changes only from the app's own origin as JSON, four security headers set in the Worker (was 0036).
- 2026-10-09: The headers reached only `/api/*`; both apps now carry `_headers` for the asset layer, the team app
  gets a content security policy, and the smoke test checks `/` (was 0092).
- 2026-10-09: Of anything personal, the bootstrap now sends a member only their own: quarterly, roles, role actions,
  outs, no-shows, walk-ins and outside teams' contacts filtered by action (was 0099).
- 2026-10-09: A change with neither `Origin` nor `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin` is refused; before, one with neither
  (or `Sec-Fetch-Site: none`) got through ([#42](https://github.com/battersea-cougars/ark/issues/42)).
- 2026-10-09: The bootstrap's filtering moved into its SQL (`club.ts`, [0057](0057-team-app-loading-and-changes.md)):
  someone else's private fields, outs, no-shows, walk-ins and contacts are no longer read and then dropped in code.
  The draft's hiding (ADR 0060) and which roles you see stay in code.
