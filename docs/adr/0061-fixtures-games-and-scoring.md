# 0061. The app makes a tournament's fixtures, and each game is scored live by one person on its own page

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-07 · updated 2026-10-09
- **Merges:** 0071, 0090

## Context

Games and Standings ran on sample data: nothing stored fixtures or results. On the day, someone has to run the clock
and keep the score while everyone else, at the rink or at home, wants to see it. A result typed in afterwards wasn't
enough, nobody wanted two phones scoring the same game, and whoever scores is on a phone, out of breath.

## Decision

### Fixtures and playoffs

- **Fixtures need two teams, nothing more**: a draft's captains ([0060](0060-the-draft.md)) or the teams that entered.
  An admin has the app make them: a round robin by the circle method (every team plays every other once, in rounds),
  then the playoff games the tournament's settings ask for. They can be made again until a game has a result; then
  they're set (409).
- **Playoffs** are a setting copied from the series like the rules ([0030](0030-training-and-tournament-schedule.md)):
  a list of games by table position, each with a name, e.g. Final (1 v 2), or Final and 3rd place. None is fine.
- `tournament_games` holds each game: stage (group / playoff), round, its place in the day's order, teams, the
  playoff's seeds, the score, status (next / live / done), the clock and who keeps score. When the last group game
  has its result, the playoffs get their teams from the table (points, goal difference, goals for).
- `lib/fixtures.ts` (round robin, table, scorekeepers, `startingNow`) is shared by the Worker and the app.

### One game on at a time

- **Only the game up next is scored**: scoring, the clock and a typed-in result go on the first game in the day's
  order that isn't over; the next opens at full time. Anything else is a 409 ("Game N is up next").
- A game being played has a score but no result: the table counts only finished games. A level playoff can't be
  called at full time: it plays on and the next goal wins.

### Who keeps score

- **A team sitting the game out is suggested** (`scorekeepers`): in the day's order, each game goes to a team not
  playing in it, turns spread evenly. It's a suggestion, shown on the fight card, the tournament's home and the game.
- **One person holds the scoresheet** (`keeper_member_id`): only they run the clock and log goals (403 for anyone
  else). Anyone can take it on while nobody has, for the game up next or on now. They let go with **Hand over**, on
  the page (or Stop scoring in Game tools); an admin can make them let go. They're done with a game at full time.

### A game's pages

- **Details opens the matchup** (`/tournaments/:slug/games/:id`, Matchup.svelte): the two teams face to face (crest,
  name, record so far; the score once there is one, else the kick-off), both squads, the goals once it's played, and
  **when the captains' sides last met** in past tournaments of the series (`lib/matchups.ts`: games with one on each
  side, as captain or player; teams are drafted afresh, so it's the people who carry over).
- **Live is the same page for everyone** (`/games/:id/live`, Game.svelte), from each fight card row still to be played
  and from the matchup: the clock, the score and the goals as they go in. Its back link returns to where it was opened.
- Under the clock it says who's keeping score, or "Nobody's keeping score" with a **Keep score** button. Taking it on
  is never the page's big button, so someone following from home can't take it by accident.

### The scoresheet

- Kept simple for a phone: the clock, one big button right under it (Start the game, Pause; Full time once time's up,
  tapped twice), with clear space before Goal for each side, and the goals. The clock itself isn't a button. Scorer
  and assist (both optional, both on that team) open in a side drawer, full width on a phone.
- **Game tools**, behind the gear in the "You're keeping score" banner: set the time (minutes and seconds left, or
  nudged by 10 seconds or a minute; only once started, never more than an hour; paused stays paused, running runs on),
  take back the last goal, full time early, stop scoring.
- **Full time** makes the score the result and fills the playoffs.
- **Starting the first game on another day asks first** ("The Kumite is on Fri 30 Oct. Start this game now? …"). Yes
  moves the tournament: its day to today, its hours so this game kicks off now (the day as long as before), its
  sign-up and draft days no later than the new day (`startingNow`), using the same save an admin makes in settings.

### The clock and updates

- The clock is stored as time left and when it last started (`clock_left_ms`, `clock_started_at`), so it survives a
  reload or a locked phone. It never ticks on the server or in storage: each phone counts down by itself, and only
  start, pause, set, goals and full time are sent. Holding ticks in a cookie was turned down: a cookie rides on every
  request, and the server would lag the pitch.
- Everyone on a live page, the scorekeeper too, gets changes as [0072](0072-live-updates.md) sets out.

### Putting a result right

- **The score is always its goals** (`tournament_goals`: team, scorer, assist, game time or none). On the game's page an
  admin can Edit the result: add a goal (who, assist, when or "don't know when"), take any one off, or set the score,
  which adds or removes nobody-said-who goals with no time to match. For the game up next, Enter the result records it
  played 0–0 and opens Set the score.

## Consequences

- Games and Standings show the real tournament, as it's played.
- `tournament_goals` opens up top scorers and assists ([0044](0044-champions-and-awards.md) uses them).
- A link to a game's live score is `/live`; the home page's keep-score duty goes there.
- Few requests while a game's on, inside the free Worker allowance ([0055](0055-degrade-instead-of-break.md)).

## History

- 2026-10-07: The app makes a round robin and playoffs once the teams are set (the draft closed); results entered
  after a game (was 0061).
- 2026-10-07: Fixtures need only two teams, not a closed draft (in 0060's merge, was 0066).
- 2026-10-08: Live scoring: one person holds the scoresheet, a clock each phone counts down, goals with scorer and
  assist, only the game up next, an admin puts results right, the score is always its goals (was 0071).
- 2026-10-08: How often live pages update became an admin setting (now ADR 0072).
- 2026-10-09: Details opens a matchup page; Live is one page for everyone, Keep score taken on deliberately and handed
  over on the page; starting the first game on another day moves the tournament (was 0090).
