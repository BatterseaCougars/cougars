# 0023. Everyone signs in with an emailed code that works only in the browser that asked for it

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-10-05 · updated 2026-10-09
- **Merges:** 0008, 0035, 0093, 0094

## Context

Every member signs in to the team app, mostly from a phone, often from the installed PWA. They won't manage
passwords well, and we won't pay for an identity provider ([0003](0003-free-tiers-only.md)). Two problems with a
plain magic link:

- On an iPhone an installed web app keeps its sign-in apart from every browser, and a link in an email always opens
  a browser, so a link could never sign in the app most members use.
- A link or a code can be forwarded, and whoever opens it is signed in.

Every request already looks the session up in D1, so that an admin can sign someone out and an inactive member is
shut out at once. With that lookup, a signed cookie adds nothing: the row decides.

Local dev needs a way to sign in when nothing is emailed from a laptop, and that way must never work on a deployed
worker.

## Decision

**Sign-in**

- A member enters their email. The Worker sets a private **nonce cookie** on that browser and emails a **6-digit
  code**, and nothing else: no link. The code signs in only alongside the nonce cookie, so a forwarded email signs no
  one in ("open this on the device you signed in from").
- Codes are sent only to the email on the member's own account. An unknown email gets the same reply, so the form
  doesn't reveal who's a member.
- Codes are stored hashed (SHA-256), are single-use and expire after 15 minutes.
- **One browser, one member, any of its codes.** A browser keeps its nonce while it asks again for the same member,
  so any code it asked for in the last 15 minutes works there, and using one spends all of them. Asking for a
  _different_ member's code starts a fresh nonce, and the earlier member's codes die with the old one. So every live
  code under a nonce is one member's, and every guess and every cap below is that member's, whoever is typing. Two
  people signing in one after the other on a shared browser each get their own code.
- **Guesses are counted before they're checked**, in one statement, and a code is spent the same way, so requests
  sent all at once can't get extra tries or two sessions. The limits:
  - 5 wrong codes per code;
  - 5 codes an hour and 10 a day per member;
  - 20 wrong codes a day per member, after which no codes are sent or accepted until the day has passed (logged as
    `sign_in.capped`);
  - per address, best effort: 10 code requests in 10 minutes and 5 requests to join an hour;
  - asking to join stops while 50 people are waiting.
- New people **request access**; an admin approves them ([0024](0024-action-based-authorization.md)).
- The email goes through the Gmail API (`shared/email.ts`, [0027](0027-email-through-gmail-api.md)).
- **Sign in with Google** (OAuth with PKCE, for a member whose verified Google email matches) is planned as a
  shortcut. It isn't built.

**Sessions**

- The session cookie holds a **random 256-bit token**. D1 keeps only its SHA-256 hash in `auth_sessions`, as it does
  for the nonce and the code. There is no signing key and no `TEAM_SESSION_SECRET`.
- The session lasts 180 days. Its expiry moves on at most once a day while it's used, so most requests read and don't
  write. Revoking the row, or making the member inactive, ends it on the next request.
- Cookies: `cougars_session` and `cougars_nonce` (15 minutes), both `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax` and `Path=/`. On https
  they're `Secure` and named with the `__Host-` prefix, so no sibling subdomain can set or shadow them.
- Sign-ins, sign-outs, capped sign-ins and requests to join go in `audit_log` ([0095](0095-audit-log.md)).

**Local dev**

- Local dev (`vite`) signs in the same way. Two switches exist for your own machine: `TEAM_ENV=local` returns the
  code in `/api/auth/start`'s reply (nothing is emailed from a laptop), and `TEAM_AUTO_ADMIN=1` in the shell makes
  any request without a session the first admin, for screenshots and tests. Only `vite`'s serve config sets them; a
  build carries neither, and `scripts/ci/target.mjs` writes only `SITE_ENV`.
- **Both switches also need a private address.** `localHere(env, request)` (`worker/auth.ts`) is true only when
  `TEAM_ENV` is `local` _and_ the request's host is loopback, a private range (10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16),
  `localhost`, or a `.test` name (reserved, never public; the tests' host). A deployed worker is reached by its
  public name, so on it the switches do nothing even if set. A phone on the house wifi still reaches the laptop by
  its LAN address.
- **A test reads `wrangler.jsonc` and `target.mjs`** and fails if either names a switch
  (`scripts/team-app-config.test.mjs`).
- **The deploy's smoke test** asks the live worker for `/api/bootstrap` with no session and fails unless it's 401.

## Consequences

- One way to sign in, the same in the PWA, in a browser and in any future store app: copy the code from the email.
- Sign-in depends on email delivery.
- No session secret to create, rotate and document.
- A stolen database can't sign anyone in, because it holds only hashes. A stolen cookie works until the session is
  revoked or the member is made inactive, the same as with a signed cookie.
- Each API request makes one indexed D1 read for the session, well inside the free tier for a club.
- The limits mean what they say: 5 wrong per code, 20 a day per member. The odds of guessing are negligible (a
  million codes, 15 minutes, ten codes a day).
- For a deploy to open up the local switches, three independent things now have to go wrong: the config, the config
  test and the smoke test.
- A tunnel to your laptop (a public name onto a local server) doesn't get the code on screen or the auto admin; sign
  in from the laptop's own address instead.
- If Google sign-in is built, it adds a Google OAuth client to the secrets and a dependency on Google for that
  shortcut.

## History

- 2026-10-05: Admins log in with a one-time magic link to an allow-listed email, with a signed session cookie (was
  0008).
- 2026-10-06: Every member signs in, with a device-bound code or link, or Google; the session an HMAC-signed cookie
  backed by `auth_sessions` (was 0023).
- 2026-10-06: The session becomes a hashed random token with no signing key; the link is dropped because it can't
  reach the installed iPhone app; guess limits counted before checking; local dev switches added (was 0035).
- 2026-10-09: A security review found nothing stopped the local switches working on a deployed worker; they now need
  a private address, a config test and a smoke test (was 0093).
- 2026-10-09: The same review found one browser holding codes for two members let guesses count against the wrong
  member; asking for another member's code now starts a fresh nonce (was 0094).
