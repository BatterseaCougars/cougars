// Scoring a game as it's played (ADR 0071). Each game suggests a team sitting it out to keep score (scorekeepers in
// lib/fixtures.ts), but one person keeps it: whoever presses Start scoring holds the scoresheet, and nobody else can
// score that game until they let it go, or an admin does (someone had to leave: anyone can take it on from there).
// The holder starts and pauses the clock, logs each goal as it goes in (who scored, who assisted, when in game
// time), takes back the last one, and calls full time, which makes the score the result. One game at a time. The
// score is on the game as it changes, so everyone sees it as it happens.
