// A member's right to go, and to see what's held about them (#30, ADR 0029). Erasing keeps the member's row, so the

// were: they become "Former member", with no email, phone, bio or bank reference, and no way back in. Their roles,
// sessions, sign-in codes and places for what's still to come go. Earlier audit entries stop naming them.
