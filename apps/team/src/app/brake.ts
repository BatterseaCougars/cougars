// The app's own brake (ADR 0055). The club's Cloudflare allowance is free and daily (Worker requests, D1 reads), and
// a request our Worker refuses still counts, so the cheapest protection is the app itself not running away:
//
//   - Background checks for others' changes wait after a failure: 10 s, doubling each time, up to 5 minutes. A
//     success puts them back. A refusal about the request itself (403, 409…) isn't the server failing.
//   - One tab makes at most `perDay` calls a day (UTC, as Cloudflare counts): a loop can't spend the club's day.
//   - Cloudflare's error 1027 means the day's Worker requests are used up: nothing is sent until they reset at
//     midnight UTC, and the app says when that is. Any other 429 that isn't ours (ours say why, as JSON), such as
//     a bot challenge or a platform blip, only slows the background checks for a minute.
