// Live pages follow along (ADR 0072): a game being scored, the tournament's home while a game's on, the draft room
// while it's open. The page holds one stream from the club's live hub, which says which parts of the club changed
// the moment they do; the page then reads its own view (one request, a 304 when it already has it). While the
// stream's open the page still checks every minute, as a safety net; when it's down (a dropped connection, a server
// without a hub), it checks on the admins' beat instead (ADR 0072), and says so. Only while the page is in view; the
// brake (ADR 0055) still has the last word: a connect is one of the tab's calls, and nothing goes out while it rests.
