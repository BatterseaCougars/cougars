# Conventions

Architecture follows gwenda-hackney/ark, simplified. Read README.md first.

**Decisions are recorded in [docs/adr/](docs/adr/README.md), one record per topic.** Read the relevant ADR before
changing how something works. Changing a decision means updating its topic's record in the same change, with a dated
History line, never a quiet edit; a new topic (a service, a rule, a pattern, a trade-off) gets a new ADR
([ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-record-decisions.md)).

## Hard rules

- **Free tiers only.** Don't add a paid service or binding (Cloudflare Images, Durable Objects that store rows,
  paid Sanity features, card-payment providers) without asking. Check limits in [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-free-tiers-only.md). A Durable Object
  that stores nothing (the live hub, ADR 0072) is fine.
- **Secrets live only in Bitwarden Secrets Manager** ([ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-secrets-in-bitwarden.md)).
  Never print secret values, never write them to files (`.env`, `.dev.vars`), never commit them. `.env` is for
  local non-secret overrides only. GitHub holds only the Bitwarden tokens (`BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN__PRODUCTION`, `__DEV`). Use
  `node scripts/env-pull.mjs --status` to see what exists (names only).
- **Every secret is documented in [README.md#secrets](README.md#secrets)**, and a provider token is named
  exactly like its secret. Adding or renaming a secret means updating that section in the same change.
- **Never deploy to production by hand.** Production deploys only from the `release` branch via
  `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`; `main` and PRs deploy dev ([ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-environments-and-deploys.md)).
  Dev is a separate Cloudflare account (workers `web` and `team`, at `web.cougars-dev.workers.dev` and `team.cougars-dev.workers.dev`) ([ADR 0010](docs/adr/0010-environments-and-deploys.md)). Your machine is dev; production secrets are `NAME__PRODUCTION`.
- **Not live yet: no migrations.** The database is `db/schema.sql` plus `db/seed/club.sql`; change them and run
  `npm run db:rebuild:local` (dev rebuilds on deploy), which keeps the data. Dev's data becomes production at
  launch; only then do migrations start ([ADR 0050](docs/adr/0050-schema-and-seed-until-launch.md), db/README.md).
- `archive/` is read-only reference. Don't import from it.

## Web app (apps/web)

These rules are for the website only. The team app (`apps/team`) is a Svelte 5 SPA on its own
Worker ([ADR 0022](docs/adr/0022-team-app-svelte-pwa.md)); its permissions follow
[ADR 0024](docs/adr/0024-action-based-authorization.md). The roadmap is [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/battersea-cougars/ark/milestones): new work is an issue in one ([ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-one-repo-two-projects.md)).

- Astro 7 + `@astrojs/cloudflare` 14 (Workers with static assets, not Pages).
- Pages are prerendered (`output: "static"`). Server routes opt out with `export const prerender = false`.
- Bindings: `import { env } from "cloudflare:workers"` (e.g. `env.DB`). Execution context: `Astro.locals.cfContext`.
  Run `npx wrangler types` in apps/web after changing `wrangler.jsonc`.
- Content comes from Sanity at build time via `src/lib/sanity/content.ts`. All GROQ lives in `queries.ts`,
  types in `types.ts`. Studio schema field names must match the GROQ projections.
- SQL: plain SQL through `packages/shared/d1.ts` helpers. One module per domain under `src/lib/server/`.
- Forms must work without JavaScript (POST + 303 redirect), enhanced with fetch + JSON.
- Dates: always format in Europe/London via `src/lib/dates.ts`.
- Images: Sanity CDN via `src/lib/sanity/images.ts`; local assets in `src/assets/` (no `public/` except favicons).

## Team app (apps/team)

- **Admin actions live on the thing's own page**, opening over it (sheet, drawer, editor panel), not buried under
  Settings; Settings is for setting up and reuses the same editors ([ADR 0065](docs/adr/0065-page-frame-and-admin-actions.md)).

## Team app dev server (apps/team)

- A library the browser imports goes in apps/team `package.json` **dependencies** (not devDependencies). Vite
  pre-bundles exactly that list at startup; `scripts/team-app-deps.test.mjs` enforces it ([ADR 0022](docs/adr/0022-team-app-svelte-pwa.md)).
- One dev server on 4510. A second `vite` is refused; stop the running one to restart. Never `--force` beside it.

## Tests

- **Use cases first** ([ADR 0031](docs/adr/0031-use-case-tests.md), [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md)): tests
  describe what someone does, drive the real handlers, and fake outside services in one fake world. Unit tests only
  for tricky pure logic. Known bugs stay as `it.fails("… (known bug #N)")`.
- Vitest, colocated `*.test.ts`. D1 is in-memory SQLite with all migrations applied (`packages/shared/testing/d1-sqlite.ts`).
  Don't mock our own code.
- Before pushing: `npm run lint && npm test && npm run check -w @cougars/web && npm run build`.

## Ports

4500 web, 4510 team app, 4520 studio. Don't use framework default ports.
